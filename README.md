This repository demonstrates how our 2023 capstone data was stored and collected using SQL. Structured query language (SQL) 
is a programming language used to store and process data. In a relational database, data is stored in tabular form, with rows and 
columns denoting various data qualities and the relationships between the values of those attributes. To store, update, remove, search 
for, and retrieve data from the database, utilize SQL statements. SQL can also be used to optimize and maintain database performance. 
All different kinds of programs typically use the well-liked query language (SQL). SQL is a popular programming language among data 
analysts and developers because it interfaces well with other programming languages. For instance, users can use the Java programming 
language to incorporate SQL queries in order to create high-performance data processing applications using popular SQL database systems 
like Oracle or MS SQL Server. Due to its use of standard English vocabulary in its statements, SQL is also fairly simple to understand.
