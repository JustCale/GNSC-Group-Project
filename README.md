This repository demonstrates how our 2023 capstone data was stored and collected using SQL. Structured query language (SQL) 
is a programming language used to store and process data. In a relational database, data is stored in tabular form, with rows and 
columns denoting various data qualities and the relationships between the values of those attributes. To store, update, remove, search 
for, and retrieve data from the database, utilize SQL statements. SQL can also be used to optimize and maintain database performance. 
All different kinds of programs typically use the well-liked query language (SQL). SQL is a popular programming language among data 
analysts and developers because it interfaces well with other programming languages. For instance, users can use the Java programming 
language to incorporate SQL queries in order to create high-performance data processing applications using popular SQL database systems 
like Oracle or MS SQL Server. Due to its use of standard English vocabulary in its statements, SQL is also fairly simple to understand. 
Our goal by the end of this project is to appropriately use SQL for its intedend use - to store and process data. The data that will be
obtained for this project was obtained from the Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation. The data consist of qualitative and
quantitative data such as deer ID numbers, harvest date, year, county, area name, age, sex, among many other catergories in which
data was accounted for. Our goal is to able to organize the obtained data in a way that is approachable and facilitates analysis
of data once it comes to that. The data that has been generated was initially recorded through an Excel sheet, and was then transferred
to the MySQL Workbench database - codes were generated and chosen fit for according to this project.  A Github repository was created
that works efficiently. Because neither Jennifer or I were familiar with this data base or its code - Youtube served as a guide to
selecting code for beginners, which as you will see is straight forward. By the end of this project, we were able to code SQL efficently
and even become proficient users (to an extent). The data that was initally collected was easily recalled to our desired use.
